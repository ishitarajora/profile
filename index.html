            <h1>Hi, I am <span>Ishita Rajora</span></h1>
            <p> Passionate and Motivated full stack developer with focus on building dynamic<br>
                and user-friendly web applications.With a strong foundation in both front-end <br>
                and back-end technologies,I strive to create seamless digital experiences that <br>
                empower businesses and enhance user interactions.<br>
                My journey in web development began when I enrolled in PG Diploma in Advance<br>
                Computing which is the flagship course of CDAC ACTS Pune.Since then, I have<br>
                honed my skills in various  programming languages such as Java ,JavaScript, SQL,<br>
                HTML, CSS, and frameworks like React, Spring, Hibernate,and SpringBoot.This diverse<br>
                skill set enables me to tackle complex challenges and deliver efficient solutions at<br>
                every stage of the development process.<br> 
                Beyond technical expertise, I am also a strong collaborator and a believer in<br>
                the power of teamwork. I thrive in agile environments where ideas are openly<br>
                shared and constructive feedback is valued. I enjoy working closely with designers,<br>
                product managers, and fellow developers to bring concepts to life and create impactful<br>
                digital solutions.<br>
                When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring the latest industry trends, attending web<br>
                development conferences, and continuously expanding my knowledge base. I have a genuine<br>
                passion for staying up-to-date with emerging technologies, best practices, and UX/UI design principles.
